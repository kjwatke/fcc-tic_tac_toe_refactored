#### How the game works: 
1.  Player chooses x or o, 1 or 2 player game.
2.  If it's a 2 player game, it simply alternates from x or o,
board is checked for a win after each drawing.
3.  If it's a 1 player game, after the player goes and his symbol is
drawn, computer will choose an empty tile based off AI logic, animate the tile
, draw it's symbol and then wait for player to go again, checking for a win
pattern after each drawing, both for the player and the computer.
4.  When win is found, animation showing winner starts, scoreboard is adjusted to reflect winner. Board is then cleared, all variables are reset, except for player choice (x or o) and it starts over again, waiting for player to click a tile.
